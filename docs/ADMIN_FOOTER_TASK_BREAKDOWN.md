Notes, decisions & follow-ups
- Tests: Focused targeted tests were added and executed. Full CI run recommended before merging.
- Environment badge: hidden in production by default (configurable via props).
- Health checks: Database uses Prisma connectivity check; Redis check is optional and only runs if REDIS_URL is set.
- Versioning: getAppVersion() prioritizes NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION then package.json.

Suggested next steps before merge
- Run full test suite: pnpm test
- Run lint & typecheck: pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck
- Manual accessibility audit (axe / Lighthouse)
- Performance smoke tests on staging
- Create PR targeting branch `zen-den` with this change set
